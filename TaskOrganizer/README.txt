---RUNNING THE JAR FILE---

1. If your PC has JavaFX installed, you should be able to run the JAR file directly.

2. If you don't have JavaFX installed, follow these instructions:

java —module-path C:\Java\javafx-sdk-19\lib —add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml,javafx.swing -jar TaskOrganizer.jar

NOTE: You'll need to change the path where JavaFX is stored on your pc.
